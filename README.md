# mongodb-patterns

Little cute Node.js application that prints out a random MongodDB data modeling pattern.

This sample app was built to test out how to use [MongoDB Atlas](https://mongodb.com/atlas) with [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io).

# Requirements

For this setup to work correctly you need the following:
* A Gitpod free account.
* A MongoDB Atlas account, preconfigured with a Project already created and an API key with Project Owner access
  * The projectId needs to be set as the Gitpod environment variable `MONGODB_ATLAS_PROJECT_ID`;
  * The API public key needs to be set as the Gitpod environment variable `MONGODB_ATLAS_PUBLIC_API_KEY`;
  * The API private key needs to be set as the Gitpod environment variable `MONGODB_ATLAS_PRIVATEC_API_KEY`.
