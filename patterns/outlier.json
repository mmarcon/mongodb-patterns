  "description": "Do you find that there are a few queries or documents that don’t fit into the rest of your typical data patterns? Are these exceptions driving your application solution? If so, the Outlier Pattern is a wonderful solution to this situation.",
  "pros": [
    "Prevents a few documents or queries from determining an application’s solution.",
    "Queries are tailored for “typical” use cases, but outliers are still addressed."
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Often tailored for specific queries, therefore ad hoc queries may not perform well.",
    "Much of this pattern is done with application code."
